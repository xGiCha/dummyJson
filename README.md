## Features

+ Dependency Injection (DI): Simplifies the creation and management of dependencies.
+ Hilt: A dependency injection library for Android that reduces boilerplate code.
+ Retrofit: A type-safe HTTP client for Android and Java to make network requests.
+ Unit Tests: Ensures the reliability and correctness of the codebase.
+ MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel): Separates UI logic from business logic, promoting a clean architecture.
+ Jetpack Compose: A modern toolkit for building native Android UI.
+ Pagination: Efficiently loads data in chunks for smooth scrolling, improving performance in lists and grids.
+ (Exists but not integrated) Room Database: A persistence library that provides an abstraction layer over SQLite to allow fluent database access while harnessing the full power of SQLite.

## Architecture
### MVVM Architecture

The app follows the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) pattern to separate the business logic from the UI. Here's a brief overview:

+ Model: Handles the data layer. It fetches data from network or local storage.
+ View: Displays the data to the user and handles user interactions.
+ ViewModel: Acts as a mediator between the View and the Model. It provides data to the View and handles user actions, updating the Model accordingly.

### Unidirectional Data Flow
The app follows a unidirectional data flow style, ensuring a predictable state management system:

+ State: Represents the entire state of the UI.
+ Events: User actions or other inputs that change the state.
+ Reducers: Functions that handle state transitions based on events.
+ Actions: Invoked by the ViewModel to update the state.

## Technologies
### Dependency Injection (DI) with Hilt
Hilt simplifies dependency injection by providing:

+ Easy setup and configuration.
+ Scoped components for better lifecycle management.
+ Integration with Jetpack libraries.

### Network Communication with Retrofit
Retrofit provides:

+ Type-safe HTTP client.
+ Simple API for defining endpoints and requests.
+ Seamless integration with coroutines for asynchronous operations.

### UI with Jetpack Compose
Jetpack Compose offers:

+ Declarative UI programming.
+ State management with State and MutableState.
+ Powerful and flexible layout system.

### Pagination with Paging Library
Pagination is implemented with the Paging Library, allowing the app to:

+ Load data incrementally and efficiently.
+ Reduce memory usage and improve performance with lazy loading.
+ Integrate seamlessly with Jetpack Compose and ViewModel.

## Testing
### Unit Tests
The app includes unit tests to ensure the correctness of:

+ ViewModels
+ UseCases
+ Repository interactions

## Improvements
+ More Unit Tests: Increase test coverage to ensure all parts of the application are reliable.
+ Better UI: Enhance the user interface for a more intuitive and engaging user experience.
+ Better Handling of Horizontal Pager: Optimize the horizontal pager for better performance and smoother user interactions.
